# Medical-Record-Smart-Contract-Sample
A very basic smart contract I have built for the medical sector.

In this smart contract, patient's medical records can be updated and only doctors having permission can access these records to read or update them.
This smart contract was written in solidity and is built using the Remix-Ethereum IDE.

## Getting Started

You will need to use the http://remix.ethereum.org/ website to run this smart contract.

### Prerequisites

You will need to activate the 'Solidity Compiler' and 'Debug and Run Transactions' extensions from the Extensions side menu.

## Running the Code
